# `tiny-tetris`

It's Tetris, except the game can be played in just a 5x5 character area of space.

## How does it work?

Essentially, we are using the Braille unicode characters (4-dots tall) to act as manipulatable sub-units in each character. With a custom Braille-powered rendering engine, we are able to make a 20 row by 10 column grid in just 5 characters by 5 characters!
